# Week 10

## Exercise 1
Create another `Comparator`, fill each and compare based on remaining volume

## Exercise 2
- Create an application called `Spotify` that plays Audio Books and Songs
- The `AudioBook` and `Song` class should implement `Playable`
- `Playable` should provide a method called `play()`
- The `Spotify` class should use a `Playlist` class to get a list of `Playable`s
- When an `AudioBook` is played, it should say the name of the author, book title, and year published
- When a `Song` is played it should say the name of the song and the artist
